# There are some chickens and some cows in Farmer John's yard.


# John's daughter Susie counted that all the animals in the yard have a total of 3 heads. 
# John's son Billy counted their legs and got a total of 8. 
# Using their answers, Farmer John easily determined that there have to be exactly 2 chickens and 1 cow.


# Write a method that will solve a general version of Farmer John's problem.
# You are given two ints heads and legs. 
# Compute the number of chickens and the number of cows. 
# Return a int[] with two elements: first the number of chickens, then the number of cows.
# If there is no solution, return an empty int[] instead.
